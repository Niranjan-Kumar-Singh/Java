ABSTRACTION — Complete Notes
============================

1) What is Abstraction?
-----------------------
Abstraction means:
   "Hiding all unnecessary details and showing only the important parts to the user."

Real-world examples:
   - Car driver uses steering, brake, accelerator (important)
     but does not need to know engine mechanism (hidden).
   - ATM hides internal banking operations from user.

In Java, abstraction is implemented using:
   1. Abstract Classes
   2. Interfaces (covered in 07_Interfaces)

This folder focuses ONLY on abstract classes.


2) Abstract Classes
-------------------
An abstract class is a class declared with the `abstract` keyword.

Example:
    abstract class Animal {
        abstract void sound();
    }

Characteristics:
----------------
✓ Cannot create object directly  
  Animal a = new Animal();   // ❌ Not allowed

✓ Can have:
   - abstract methods (without body)
   - normal methods (with body)
   - variables
   - constructors
   - static methods
   - final methods

✓ MUST be inherited


3) Abstract Methods
-------------------
A method without implementation (no body).

Example:
    abstract void sound();

Rules:
------
✓ No body  
✓ Ends with semicolon  
✓ Child class MUST implement it  
✓ If subclass does NOT implement all abstract methods → subclass also becomes abstract  


4) Why Use Abstract Classes?
----------------------------
- To enforce a rule for child classes  
- To provide a template or blueprint  
- To implement common behavior in base class  
- To force subclasses to override specific methods  
- Encourages cleaner, structured code  


5) Constructor in Abstract Classes
----------------------------------
Important point:
    Abstract class CAN have constructors.

Why?
    They run BEFORE subclass constructor to initialize base variables.

Example flow:
    new Dog();
        → Animal constructor
        → Dog constructor


6) Differences: Abstract Class vs Concrete Class
-------------------------------------------------

| Feature             | Abstract Class              | Concrete Class        |
|-------------------- |-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Object creation     | Not allowed                 | Allowed               |
| Abstract methods    | Can have                    | Cannot have           |
| Constructors        | Allowed                     | Allowed               |
| Purpose             | Provide partial structure   | Full implementation   |
| Inheritance         | MUST be inherited           | Optional              |


7) When to Use Abstract Classes?
--------------------------------
Use an abstract class when:
✓ You want to provide a base class with common code  
✓ You want some methods mandatory for subclasses  
✓ You want shared variables and constructors  
✓ You want to define a partial implementation plus rules  


8) Example Summary
------------------

abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();  // must be overridden
    void sleep() {}         // common across all animals
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() { System.out.println("Cat meows"); }
}


9) Interview Questions
----------------------

1. What is abstraction?
2. Can abstract classes have constructors?
3. Can abstract classes have normal methods?
4. Can an abstract class have zero abstract methods?
5. Difference between abstract class and interface?
6. Can an abstract class have static methods?
7. Can abstract classes have final methods?
8. What happens if subclass does not implement an abstract method?
9. Why can’t we create objects of an abstract class?
10. Why do we need abstraction in real-world projects?


10) Summary (Easy to Remember)
------------------------------
✔ Abstraction hides details and shows essential parts  
✔ Abstract class = partial abstraction  
✔ Cannot instantiate abstract class  
✔ Can have constructors & normal methods  
✔ Subclass MUST implement abstract methods  
✔ Used for common shared logic + rules  
✔ Interfaces provide full abstraction (covered in next topic)
