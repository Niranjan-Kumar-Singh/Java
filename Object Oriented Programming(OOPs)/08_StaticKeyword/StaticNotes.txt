Static Keyword — Notes
======================

1) What is 'static'?
--------------------
- 'static' makes a member belong to the class, not to instances.
- There is only one copy of static fields per class loader.

2) What can be static?
----------------------
- Variables (static fields)
- Methods (static methods)
- Blocks (static initialization blocks)
- Nested classes (static nested classes / static inner classes)

3) Static Variables
-------------------
- Shared across all instances.
- Useful for constants, counters, caches.
- Access via ClassName.variable (recommended).

Example:
    class A { static int count; }

4) Static Methods
-----------------
- Called without creating objects: ClassName.method()
- Cannot access non-static (instance) members directly.
- Useful for utility functions (e.g., Math.sqrt).

5) Static Initialization Block
------------------------------
- Runs once when the class is loaded.
- Useful for complex static initialization (reading config, preparing maps).
- Executes before main or any constructor when class loads.

6) Static Nested Classes
------------------------
- Declared static inside a class.
- Do not require an outer class instance to be created.
- Useful for grouping helper classes (builders, helpers).

7) Common Interview Points
--------------------------
- Difference between static and instance members.
- When static initialization block runs.
- Can static methods be overridden? (No; they are hidden)
- Static variables and thread-safety (use synchronization for shared mutable static state)
- Why static is used for main method? (JVM needs an entry point without creating an object)

8) Best Practices
-----------------
- Prefer constants: public static final TYPE NAME = value;
- Keep mutable static variables to a minimum.
- Access static via ClassName to improve readability.
- Use static nested classes for logical grouping, not inner classes that need references to outer instances.
