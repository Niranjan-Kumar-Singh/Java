SUPER KEYWORD — COMPLETE NOTES
==============================

1) What is super?
-----------------
super is a keyword used to refer to the immediate parent class object.

super has 3 major uses:
1. To access parent's variables
2. To access parent's methods
3. To call parent's constructor (constructor chaining)

super is always used inside a child class.


2) Accessing Parent Variables
-----------------------------
If child and parent have same variable name:

    super.variableName

Used to avoid confusion when both parent and child contain
variables with the same name.


3) Accessing Parent Methods
---------------------------
If child overrides a parent method, you can still call the
parent version using:

    super.methodName();


4) Calling Parent Constructor
-----------------------------
super() must be the FIRST line inside a child constructor.

Examples:
    super();                // calls parent's default constructor
    super("message");       // calls parent's parameterized constructor


5) Constructor Chaining
-----------------------
Constructor chaining means:
Child constructor → calls Parent constructor → completes execution.

Java automatically inserts super() if you don't write it.

Example flow:
    new Child()
        → Parent()
        → Child()


6) Why use super?
-----------------
- To reuse parent code
- To avoid naming conflicts
- To maintain clarity
- To ensure proper initialization of parent class members


7) Can't use super in static context
------------------------------------
super belongs to object-level hierarchy, not class-level.

So:
    static methods cannot use super()


8) Interview Questions
----------------------
1. What is super? Why do we use it?
2. Can super be used in static methods? (No)
3. Can super() be anywhere in constructor? (No, must be first line)
4. What happens if we don’t write super()?
5. Difference between this() and super()?
