Packages in Java — Notes
========================

1) What is a package?
   - A package groups related classes and interfaces.
   - It corresponds to a folder structure in the filesystem.
   - Helps avoid name collisions and controls visibility.

2) Common package conventions:
   - Use reverse-domain names: com.example.project
   - Keep source files under a 'src' folder and compile to 'out' (or bin).

3) Access modifiers and packages:
   - public: accessible everywhere
   - protected: accessible in same package and subclasses (even in other packages)
   - default (no modifier): package-private — accessible only within same package
   - private: accessible only within class

4) Compile & run commands (PowerShell / Windows):
   # from 10_Packages root:
   javac -d out src\com\example\app\PackageDemo.java
   java -cp out com.example.app.PackageDemo

   # To compile everything explicitly:
   javac -d out src\com\example\**\*.java

5) Packaging best practices:
   - Use packages to separate layers (model, service, util, api).
   - Keep package-private members for internal API only.
   - Use public API sparingly and document it.

6) Common pitfalls:
   - Forgetting package statement at top of file when moving file into package folders.
   - Trying to access package-private members from another package (compile error).
   - Using default package (no package) for production code — avoid it.

7) IDE tips (VS Code / IntelliJ):
   - When creating files, add package declaration first.
   - Use 'javac -d out' to deploy classes into correct folders.
