Final Keyword — Complete Notes
==============================

1) What does final mean?
   - 'final' marks members or classes as unchangeable in specific ways:
     • final variable: value/reference cannot be reassigned after initialization
     • final method: cannot be overridden by subclasses
     • final class: cannot be extended (no subclassing)

2) Final variables
   - Primitive final: value cannot change
   - Reference final: reference cannot be reassigned, but object's internal state can be mutated
   - Blank final: a final instance variable without initializer; must be assigned exactly once (in constructor or instance initializer)
   - Final local variables: cannot be reassigned after set

3) Final methods
   - Prevent overriding, useful to lock behavior
   - Often used in security-sensitive or library classes

4) Final classes
   - Prevent inheritance
   - Common in immutable classes (e.g., java.lang.String)
   - Useful when you want to guarantee behavior won't change via subclassing

5) Final vs finally vs finalize
   - final: keyword (this topic)
   - finally: block in try-catch used for cleanup
   - finalize(): method in Object called by GC (deprecated, avoid using)

6) Common interview points
   - Can final variable be left uninitialized? (Yes, as blank final assigned later)
   - Can final fields be serialized? (Yes, but special rules may apply)
   - Is it good practice to use final everywhere? (Used for immutability and thread-safety, but not blindly)
   - Can a method be both static and final? (Yes; static methods are hidden, not overridden. final prevents override but static cannot be overridden anyway)

7) Example summary
   - final int x = 5; // cannot change x
   - final Person p = new Person("A"); p.setAge(20); // allowed, but p = new Person("B") is not

8) Best practices
   - Use final for constants: public static final TYPE NAME = value;
   - Use final fields to create immutable objects
   - Use final methods/classes when you need to prevent extension/override for correctness/security
