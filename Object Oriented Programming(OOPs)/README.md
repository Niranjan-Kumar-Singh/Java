# Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java

This section contains a complete, structured, and well-documented set of Java programs covering all major OOPs topics.  
Each topic has its own folder, examples, and a dedicated `Main` demo file.

The folder is designed to be:
- Easy to study  
- Easy to navigate  
- Interview-friendly  
- Beginner-friendly  
- Clean and professional for GitHub

## 📚 Topics Covered

This OOP directory covers **every important OOP concept**, including:

### ✔ 01 — Basics  
- Classes & Objects  
- Fields and Methods  
- Memory explanation (Heap & Stack)  
- Access Modifiers (public, private, protected, default)

### ✔ 02 — Getters, Setters & Encapsulation  
- Why we hide data (`private`)  
- Controlled access with getters/setters  
- Real-life example: BankAccount  
- Data validation inside setters  

### ✔ 03 — Constructors  
- Default Constructor  
- Parameterized Constructor  
- Constructor Overloading  
- Copy Constructor  
- Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy  
- How memory behaves with arrays/references  
- Java Garbage Collector (simple explanation)

### ✔ 04 — Inheritance  
- Single Level  
- Multi Level  
- Hierarchical  
- Method Overriding basics  
- Code reuse and polymorphism foundations  

(Additional folders like Polymorphism, Abstraction, Interfaces, etc. will be added as development continues.)

## 🧠 Oops.java — The Master Theory File

The root-level file `Oops.java` contains:

- All definitions  
- Explanations  
- Concepts  
- Short examples  
- Interview notes  
- Comparison tables  
- Tips and tricks  

It is written entirely in comments so it compiles and stays inside the project as documentation.

## ▶️ How to Compile & Run

### Run only a specific folder demo:

```bash
cd "01_Basics"
javac *.java
java ClassAndObjectDemo
````

```bash
cd "02_GettersSetters_Encapsulation"
javac *.java
java EncapsulationDemo
```

```bash
cd "03_Constructors"
javac *.java
java CopyConstructorDemo
```

```bash
cd "04_Inheritance"
javac *.java
java SingleInheritanceDemo
```

Each folder includes one main demo file based on the topic group.

## 🎓 Why This Structure?

* Cleaner than keeping all files in one folder
* Perfect for revision before interviews
* Easy to understand topic grouping
* Each concept has its own small, focused example
* Allows adding more OOP topics (Polymorphism, Abstraction, Interfaces, etc.)
