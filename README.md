# Java Practice Repository

This repository contains my Java practice programs organized topic-wise. It includes core Java concepts as well as Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. The goal of this repository is to serve as a structured reference for revision and learning.

## 📌 About This Repository
- Topic-wise structured Java programs
- Clean and beginner-friendly code style
- Covers both Core Java and DSA
- Continuously updated with new problems

## 🎯 Purpose
- Strengthen Java fundamentals
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Build revision-ready codebase
- Prepare for interviews and placement exams

## 🛠 How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository
2. Open any `.java` file in an IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse) or compile with `javac`
3. Run using `java ClassName`

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add README for each topic folder
- Add explanation comments to all programs
- Add time/space complexity notes
- Add level-wise DSA roadmap

## 🧬 History of Java
Java was first developed by *James Gosling* at Sun Microsystems in 1995. It was initially designed for interactive television, but soon it became popular because of its **platform independence**. The motto of Java — **“Write Once, Run Anywhere”** — comes from its ability to run on any device having the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Java later became open-source and is now maintained by Oracle Corporation. Over time, it evolved into one of the most widely used programming languages for:
- Android development
- Enterprise applications
- Banking and finance systems
- Web applications
- Distributed systems

## 🌍 Why Java is Important
✔ Platform independent (WORA)  
✔ Huge standard library & strong community  
✔ Very secure & robust  
✔ Used in real-world, large-scale applications  
✔ Backbone of Android development  
✔ Highly stable & future-proof language
